    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole wheat flour (atta)</li>
        <li>Fresh paneer (cottage cheese)</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Green chilies</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves</li>
        <li>Garam masala</li>
        <li>Red chili powder</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Make Paneer Paratha:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the stuffing: Grate the fresh paneer and finely chop onions, green chilies, and fresh coriander leaves. Mix them together and add garam masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Create a well-mixed stuffing mixture.</li>
        <li>Make the dough: In a separate bowl, take whole wheat flour, add a pinch of salt, and enough water to form a soft, pliable dough. Divide it into small balls, slightly larger than a golf ball.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough: Take one dough ball, flatten it, and create a small well in the center. Place a portion of the paneer mixture inside. Seal the edges and roll it into a round paratha, using a rolling pin and some flour to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Cook the paratha: Heat a griddle (tava) or a non-stick pan. Place the rolled paratha on it and cook both sides, applying oil or ghee, until they turn golden brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>Serve hot: Paneer Parathas are best enjoyed when hot and crispy. Serve with yogurt, pickle, or chutney of your choice.</li>
