<h1>CHOCOLATE CAKE</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    The best eggless chocolate cake has to have all of its components be up to mark. 
    This doesn’t mean that there needs to be multiple components and all complicated ones to make one of the best cakes. 
    This eggless chocolate cake only has two components – devil’s food sponge cake and chocolate fudge frosting. 
</p>
<p>
    Devil’s food cake is an extremely famous chocolate cake all over the world. It gets it’s name from being decadent and beautifully sinful. 
    The characteristic feature of a devil’s food cake is that it has a light and airy cake sponge, and it always has a richer and darker color than other chocolate cakes.
    In all devil’s food cake recipes you will see baking soda as one of the ingredients.
    This is what makes the sponge airy and light and also adds more color as baking soda reacts with cocoa powder. 
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup whole wheat flour – leveled, 120 grams or 1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>¾ cup raw sugar or white sugar – 150 grams</li>
    <li>1 cup cold water</li>
    <li>¼ cup sunflower oil or any neutral tasting oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice – swap with apple cider vinegar or white vinegar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract or vanilla powder or ¼ teaspoon vanilla essence</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Pre-heat the oven to 180 deg C.</li>
    <li>Mix the plain flour, coco powder and baking soda and sieve them to ensure even mixing. Keep aside.</li>
    <li>Mix water, sugar, salt and make sure the sugar gets dissolved and then add lemon juice/ vinegar, oil and vanilla essence. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Add the sifted flour and mix well.</li>
    <li>Grease a baking pan with oil and dust with some flour, then pour the batter to it. (the batter will be watery)</li>
    <li>Bake for 35 – 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out dry. Mine got baked at 35 minutes.</li>
    <li>After done, cool down the cake for 5 minutes and then invert in a wire rack, let it get cooled completely and then cut into pieces.</li>
    <li>When I tried inverting the cake immediately last time I had some broken pieces, so this time I waited for some time and then invert the cake in wire rack. Don't let it cool down for more than 15 minutes.</li>
</ol>
